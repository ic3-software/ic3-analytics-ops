# OpenReport

Open a report using a local `Chrome` instance.

By default, this task asserts the report can be opened and is ready for printing (the dashboard is opened
simulating a `Print in Browser` action).

Note the execution of the MDX statements as generated by this task are **using the server MDX result cache**.

## JSON Definition

```typescript
interface OpenReportTask {

    reportPath: string;

    // Default : 30 seconds.
    timeoutS?: number;

}
```
