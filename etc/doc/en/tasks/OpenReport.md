# OpenReport

Open a report using a local `Chrome` instance.

By default, this task asserts the report can be opened and is ready for printing (the dashboard is opened
simulating a `Print in Browser` action). When defined, an assertion can be used to ensure the user has no
access to the given report (security testing).

Note the execution of the MDX statements as generated by this task are **using the server MDX result cache**.

## JSON Definition

```typescript
interface OpenReportTask extends Task<OpenReportAssertion> {

    reportPath: string;

    // Default : 30 seconds.
    timeoutS?: number;

}

interface OpenReportAssertion extends Assertion {

    missing: boolean;

}
```

```json5
{
  action: "OpenReport",
  reportPath: "shared:/ic3-analytics-ops",
  assertions: [
    {
      missing: true
    }
  ]
}
```
