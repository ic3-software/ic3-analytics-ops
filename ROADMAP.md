# Roadmap

Here is a non-exhaustive list of upcoming features and developments in no specific order. This is an ongoing
initiative so feel free to comment and ask for new features.


**Cypress Tests**

For ad-hoc dashboard/report tests right from the shell as well : re-use/improve the `command` file from the
Cypress [ic3-dashboard-testing](https://github.com/ic3-software/ic3-dashboard-testing) project.

**Reporters**

For reporting the result (success, failures, progress) of tests. Have something flexible enough to collect
metrics required for load testing as well. By the way, improve the REST API to retrieve remotely some OS
information (system load, RAM usage, etc...).

**Visual Non-Regression**

Investigate how to integrate icCube testing for non-regression in widget (chart, table, filter, etc...) rendering.

**Docker**

Deploy and run anywhere the shell.
