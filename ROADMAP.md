# Roadmap

Here is a non-exhaustive list of upcoming features and developments in no specific order. This is an ongoing
initiative so feel free to comment and ask for new features.

**Stress Tests**

Compared to 'Performance Tests' would be nice to be able to scale the actors automatically until the system breaks
down to identify the maximum throughput it can handle :

- duplicate actor on-the-fly based on whatever profile
- reporting of result over time

**Cypress Tests**

For ad-hoc dashboard/report tests right from the shell as well : re-use/improve the `command` file from the
Cypress [ic3-dashboard-testing](https://github.com/ic3-software/ic3-dashboard-testing) project.

**Visual Non-Regression**

Investigate how to integrate icCube testing for non-regression in widget (chart, table, filter, etc...) rendering.

**Reporters**

For reporting the result (success, failures, progress) of tests.

**Docker**

Deploy and run anywhere the shell.
